# Directory Serve (dirserve)

A simple rust app that host the current directory to the web

## Ideal Use case

Sometimes you want to host a file on your machine so someone else or you can quickly access from another device (phone, tablet, or just aother machine).  It would nice to able to though it up on webserver and access it, but that can be more setup and not something you really want up for long.

This is a binary you can run and it will host your currrent directory with manybe a few options.

## Option Ideas

- Port
- Time ( how long to keep web server open)
